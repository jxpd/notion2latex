# --- --- --- --- --- ---
# How to use the script
# --- --- --- --- --- ---
# 1. Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `notion2latex.py`).
# 2. Make sure your input Markdown file (e.g., 'input.md') and your
#    .tex template files are in the SAME DIRECTORY as the script.
# 3. Run the script from your terminal: python3 notion2latex.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The script will now look for the input file in its own directory.
